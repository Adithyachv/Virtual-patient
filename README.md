But it will take very much time that to wait to assist all the types of patients.


# SOLUTION

For above problem statement we are started working with the different type of ML models. and we tried to restic the model to that particular doctor field only . for that purpose i had different types of chat models such Dialogpt,bert model and give a contraint matter. when you ask a particular question regarding the constraint the model refine the question answer within the give constraint paragraph .
CONSTRAINT PARAGRAPH: means a paragraph written , paragraph consists of matter regarding the name of patient type disesase and how long sufferning and the types of symptoms he having and all things that need to communicate with the docotor while we approch a doctor ,in the code it self the model understand that paragraph when we run i opens a console to ask questions when the doctor asks the question then it reply with the matter in the paragraph.
